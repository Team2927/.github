# πRhoTechs Code of Conduct
## What is FIRST?

FIRST is defined as `F`or `I`nspiration and `R`ecognition of `S`cience and `T`echnology

### The mission at FIRST is to inspire a generation of science and technology leaders who are both gracious and professional. 

<br>

This in its essence, means that this organization, and all three of its competitions, is training high school and middle school students to be the next generation of \
`Scientists`, `Engineers`, `Designers`, `Inventors`, & `Members of other Disciplines of Science`. 

<br>

This/The `FIRST Code of Conduct` lists some of the basic behaviors `mentors`, `coaches`, `volunteers`, `team members`, `affiliate partners`, `contractors`, `staff`, \
& other `participants` should adhere to while participating in FIRST activities. 

- Exhibit `Gracious Professionalism®` at all times. Gracious Professionalism is a way of doing things that `encourages high-quality work`, `emphasizes` the \
`value` of `others`, & `respects individuals & the community`. With Gracious Professionalism, `fierce competition` & `mutual gain` are `NOT separate notions`.
- `Do Not` engage in any form of `bullying`, `harassment`, `use of profane or insulting language`, or `any actual or threatened violence`.
- Ensure the `safety` of `all participants in FIRST activities`.
- Adhere to all FIRST Youth Protection Program (YPP) policies.
- Report any unsafe behavior to event or local FIRST leadership.

## Persons who do not comply with this Code of Conduct may be barred from participating in FIRST activities.

 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at {your_email}. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
